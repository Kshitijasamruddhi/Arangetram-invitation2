                      In Tamil language "Arangam" means a stage and "Etram" means to enter. The word "Arangetram" means the debut performance on stage. In South India, it is customary to present the debut recital for a knowledgeable audience when the guru decides that the students have developed the capability to present the art form for an audience. 
                      In addition to the Arangetram being an indication for the dance student's achievement of competency in that art form, the guru is responsible for affirming that the dancer has developed the required qualification. In short, it is an assessment of proficiency of both the guru and the student. Arangetram is a momentous milestone in the dancer's life as an artist and the teacher's journey in this art form.ly, she organized numerous programs through various social media platforms. Her reputation flourishes due to her ability to accommodate large number of students, all of whom achieve exceptional marks in their exams. She firmly believes that devotion is the cornerstone of the Dance discipline.
